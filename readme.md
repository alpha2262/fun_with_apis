**NOTE:** This weekend's homework is **OPTIONAL**! Feel free to spend the next two days taking it easy.

## Fun with APIs

Your homework prompt for this weekend is an open-ended one: make something cool using a 3rd party API! There's no need to create a backend for this assignment -- just stick to HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Not sure where to start? Here is a suggested workflow...
  1. **Set up your HTML and CSS.** Figure out what you want your app to look like.
  2. **Create your AJAX call.** Just make sure it's working -- don't worry about handling the response yet.
  3. **Extract information from your response.** How do you go about accessing it?
  4. **Handle API Response.** What are you going to do with the API response? How will you render it in your HTML/CSS?
  5. **AJAX error handling.** What will your program do when your API call doesnt work?

API's you can use but are not limited to include...

* [Giphy](https://api.giphy.com/)
* [OMDB (Open Movie Database)](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
* [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/)
* [Soundcloud](https://developers.soundcloud.com)
* [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview)
* [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api)

There's an API for pretty much everything. You can search for more at [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/explore).

Need an app idea? Feel free to give these prompts a try...
* [Spotify.me](https://github.com/ga-dc/spotify-me)
* [Movie Browser](https://github.com/ga-dc/movie-browser)

Like all your other homework assignments, please include a score for Comfort and Completeness. We would also like you to include a question(s) or highlight a particular portion of your application that you would like instructor feedback on.

Have a great weekend!
